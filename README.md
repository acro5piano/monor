# monor

List commands of each yarn workspaces

![image](https://github.com/acro5piano/monor/blob/master/demo.gif)

# Why

Every time I run yarn workspaces commands, I have to type `yarn workspace @myapp/package start`, which is a kind of hard work.

With `monor`, you can select your workspaces command interactively.

# Getting started

Install it globally:

```
npm -g install monor
```

Then just run `monor` to list all of your commands under your workspaces:

```
monor
```
